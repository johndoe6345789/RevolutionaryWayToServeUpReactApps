# Agent docs

Background material for the "agents" concept in this project lives here.

- `agents-details/` – deeper documentation on architecture (plugin system, lifecycle builder), interfaces (CLI/Web UI), safety practices, and the developer persona that the platform targets. Start with `agents-details/README.md` for the full table of contents.
- `old-system/` – legacy notes kept for historical reference.

Use this folder to collect any new guidance for contributors building or extending the agent-based tooling.
