# GitHub configuration

Automation, CI, and repository-level policy files live here.

- **Workflows (`.github/workflows`)** run linting, tests, releases, and Docker publishing for the project. See the workflow README for a quick map of each job.
- **Dependabot (`dependabot.yml`)** keeps npm and GitHub Action dependencies up to date on a weekly schedule.

If you add new CI pipelines or repository automation, place them here so contributors can find everything GitHub-related in one place.
